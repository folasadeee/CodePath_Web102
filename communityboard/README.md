## Notes

* Vite and React are new to me, so it took some time to get oriented and understand how to set things up properly. React's documentation was helpful, but the learning curve was steeper than expected.
* Flexbox continues to trip me up at times. Getting the banner positioned properly with the right alignments, sizing, and responsive behavior took more time than expected. However, a combination of concentrated testing/debugging, AI, and online resources helped me create the user interface I had envisioned.
* Overall, building this app pushed me out of my comfort zone in terms of tools and tech used. Overcoming those challenges through troubleshooting, digging into docs, and googling issues will ultimately level up my skills, even if it was frustrating at times.
